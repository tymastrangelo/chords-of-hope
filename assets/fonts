The `/chords-of-hope/chords-of-hope/src/assets/fonts` directory is intended to contain custom font files used in the project. Since this is a directory, it does not contain any specific file contents. You can place your font files (e.g., `.woff`, `.woff2`, `.ttf`, etc.) in this directory as needed.

This directory is intentionally left blank.
